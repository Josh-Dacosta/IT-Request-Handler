Dear IT Office,
I am a manager in the Product Design department and we need a new computer-aided design (CAD) workstation. The workstation should have a high-performance graphics card and sufficient processing power to run our design software. Possibly something from the Dell Precision line. Oh and it needs 2 TB of storage! Can you please help us with this request?
Thank you,
[Manager's Name]
